    "> **Data science** uses a multi-disciplinary field that extracts knowledge and insights from data.  When we say multi-disciplinary we mean the combination of three fields: computer programming, statistics, and business intelligence.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can begin to see why data science is so relevant to our world.  We have more and more data, and so we need to learn proper ways to use that data to take action.  As a data scientist, we use three main disciplines to do this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *computer programming* to collect and organize data,  \n",
    "2. *statistics and machine learning* to extract insights from this data and \n",
    "3. *business intelligence* to explain the analysis recommend actions based on the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations can use the data science ultimately guide how they take action and take data driven decisions.  Let's get started.  \n",
