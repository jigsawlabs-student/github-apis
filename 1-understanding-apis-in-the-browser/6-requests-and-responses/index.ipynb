    "In the last lesson we saw that we can see patterns in how websites on the Internet are organized.

When you click on a contact in your cell phone, the cell phone uses the related phone number, which is the unique number for the phone on the other end.  Now, websites work similarly.  When you type in a website name like ESPN.com, this gets translated into a long number -- `35.174.157.242` in the case of ESPN -- that is the unique *ip address* of that file.  \n",
    "\n",
