    "So far we have learned more about how the Internet works.  That is, we learned how the browser makes a  **request** and receives a **response** from another computer connected to the Internet.  When requesting information (as opposed to changing information), we generally make a `GET` request from a URL's `resource`.  When requesting information from an API, we are generally returned a JSON so that programming languages like Python can interact with them.\n",
